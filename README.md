# Multicollinearity-R
With this code we want to test the claim <br />
that SVM is extremely robust aginst the problem of multicollinearity <br />
as stated for example at pag.190 of "Machine Learning with R Cookbook" (Di Yu-Wei, Chiu): <br />
"It also does not suffer from local optima and multicollinearity" <br />

Comparison performed with two model:

1. SVM
2. Logistic
