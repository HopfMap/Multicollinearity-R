# Multicollinearity-R
With this code we want to test the claim\n
that SVM is extremely robust aginst the problem of multicollinearity\n
as stated for example at pag.190 of "Machine Learning with R Cookbook" (Di Yu-Wei, Chiu):\n
"It also does not suffer from local optima and multicollinearity"\n

Comparison performed with two model:\n
1- SVM
2- Logistic
